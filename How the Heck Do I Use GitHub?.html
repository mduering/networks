            <http://lifehacker.com/5744113/learn-to-code-the-full-beginners-guide>

If you've been looking to learn how to code, we can help you get
started. Here are 4.5 lessons on the basics and extra resources to keep
you… Read…
<http://lifehacker.com/5744113/learn-to-code-the-full-beginners-guide>

Dear Lifehacker,
I've learned to code
<http://lifehacker.com/5744113/learn-to-code-the-full-beginners-guide>
and want to start using GitHub to manage my projects. Despite the
introductory lesson they provide, I still don't understand how it works
at all. Can you help me? P

Sincerely,
Git HelpP

Dear GH,
GitHub's a great tool but it's definitely a little confusing the first
time around (and, possibly, a few times after that). That's likely why
GitHub created software (for OS X <http://mac.github.com/> and Windows
<http://windows.github.com/>) to make the process a bit easier.
Nevertheless, it's good to learn the old-fashioned way otherwise your
options in the simplified software won't make sense. Let's start by
walking through the basics.P

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      Step One: Sign Up for GitHubP

How the Heck Do I Use GitHub?SExpand

Here comes the easy part: make yourself a GitHub account signing up on
the front page <https://github.com/>. After completing the form, GitHub
will sign you in and take you to your empty news feed. In the middle of
the page, you'll see the boot camp (pictured to the right). We're going
to go through it to set up your account and, later, create your first
repository. Click on "Set Up Git" to get started.P


      Step Two: Install GitP

How the Heck Do I Use GitHub?SExpand

GitHub exists because of a version control application called |git|. The
site is based around how git works, and git is pretty old. It runs via
the command line and has no fancy graphical user interface. Since it's
made to manage code /you/ wrote, this shouldn't sound too scary. (Of
course, as previously mentioned, GitHub did make wonderful software to
allow you to use their service without the command line but that won't
help you too much unless you know the basics.)P

Git works by reading a local code repository (just a folder containing
code for your project) on your computer and the mirroring that code
elsewhere (in this case, GitHub's servers). Initially we'll commit (i.e.
send) your entire local repository to GitHub, but that's just a one-time
affair. As you continue to work on your code, you'll simply commit
changes. GitHub will then keep track of the changes you made, creating
different versions of files so you can revert back to old ones if you
want (or just keep track of those changes for other reasons). This is
primarily why you'd want to use a version control system like git on
your own, but additional benefits surface when using git to manage code
with other people working on your project. When multiple developers
commit code with git, GitHub becomes a central repository where all the
code that everyone's working on can stay in sync. You'll commit your
changes, and other developers will pull them (i.e. sync them to their
local repository). You'll do the same with their code.P

Git makes this all happen, so you need to download the latest version
<http://git-scm.com/downloads> and install it. On OS X, you'll just
install the command line app. On Windows, you'll get a few more items.
We'll discuss how they work in the next step.P


      Step Three: Set Up GitP

How the Heck Do I Use GitHub?SExpand

To set up git, you need to make your way into the command line. On OS X,
that means launching the Terminal app (Hard Drive -> Applications ->
Utilities -> Terminal) and on Windows that means launching the Git Bash
app you just installed—/not/ the Windows command prompt. When you're
ready, tell git your name like this:P

|git config —global user.name "Your Name Here"|P

For example, mine would look like this because I'm using a test account
for this example:P

|git config —global user.name "Adam Dachis"|P

You can put in any name you like, but afterwards you'll need to input
your email and that email /must/ be the email you used when signing up
for GitHub:P

|git config —global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"|P

If, for whatever reason, you signed up for GitHub with the wrong email
address, you'll need to change it
<https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-change-my-primary-email-address>.P

Now, to avoid always entering your login credentials and generating SSH
keys, you'll want to install the credential helper so your passwords are
cached. If you're on Windows, download it
<https://github.com/downloads/anurse/git-credential-winstore/git-credential-winstore.exe>
and install it. If you're on OS X, you'll need to handle this through
the Terminal. To start, use this command to download the credential helper:P

|curl -s -O \
http://github-media-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/osx/git-credential-osxkeychain|P

This will download a tiny little file and shouldn't take too long. When
finished, enter the following command to make sure the permissions are
correct on the file you just download (and fix them if not):P

|chmod u+x git-credential-osxkeychain|P

Now it's time to install the credential helper into the same folder
where you install git. To do so, enter this command:P

|sudo mv git-credential-osxkeychain `dirname \`which git\``|P

You'll be prompted for your administrator password because the above
command began with sudo. Sudo is shorthand for "super user do" and is
necessary when performing a task that requires root access. The sudo
command allows you to become the root user (a user with permission to do
pretty much anything) on your operating system for a moment so you can
perform this task. You're asked to enter your password to prove you're
an administrator on the computer and should be allowed to do this. Once
you've entered your password and the credential helper has been moved,
finish up the installation with this command:P

|git config —global credential.helper osxkeychain|P

Now you're all set and can move on to actually using git and GitHub!P


      Step Four: Create Your First RepositoryP

How the Heck Do I Use GitHub?SExpand

Now that you've made it this far, you can actually use GitHub! As a
first order of business, we're going to create a repository (or "repo"
for short). Head on over to GitHub and click the "New Repository" button
on the top right of your account page. (Note: If you're still displaying
the GitHub bootcamp section, it'll show up underneath it.)P

When creating a repository you have a few things to decide including
it's name and whether it'll be publicly accessible or not. Choosing a
name should be pretty simple because you likely already have a name for
your project. If you're just following along for learning purposes, use
"Hello-World." Why "Hello-World" and not "Hello World"? Because spaces
and special characters will cause problems. Keep it simple and easy to
type in the command line. If you want to include a more complex name,
you can add it to the optional description field beneath the name field.P

If you're creating an open-source project, you want a public repository.
If you want to code by yourself or share only with specific people, a
private repository will do. Make the choice that works best for you and
your project.P

When you're all done, you can click the "Create repository" button but
you might want to do one other thing first: check the "Initialize this
repository with a README" checkbox. Why? All repositories require a
README file. Ideally that file would contain a little information about
your project, but you might not want to deal with that right now. By
initializing the repository with a README, you'll get an empty README
file that you can just deal with later. For the purposes of this
tutorial, we're going to leave the box /unchecked/ because, in the next
section, we're going to create a README file from scratch to practice
committing (sending) it to GitHub.P


      Step Five: Make Your First CommitP

How the Heck Do I Use GitHub?SExpand

When you send files to GitHub, you /commit/ them. To practice, we're
going to initialize your local repository and create a README file to
commit as practice. Before you start, you need to know where your local
code repository is on your computer and how to access it via the command
line. In this tutorial, we're going to assume there's a directory called
"Hello-World" in your computer's home folder. If you need to create one,
just run this command (same for Git Bash on Windows and OS X's terminal):P

|mkdir ~/Hello-World|P

Now change to that directory using the cd (change directory) command:P

|cd ~/Hello-World|P

In case you were wondering, the ~ represents your home directory in Git
Bash and Terminal. It's simply shorthand so you don't have to type it
all out (which would look more like /Users/yourusername/). Now that your
repository is ready, type this:P

|git init|P

If you already had a repository ready to go, you'd just need to cd to
that directory and then run the |git init| command in there instead.
Either way, your local repository is ready to go and you can start
committing code. But wait, you don't have anything to commit! Run this
command to create a README file:P

|touch README|P

Let's take a break for a second and see what just happened. Go into the
home folder on your computer and look at the Hello-World folder (or look
at whatever folder you're using for a local repository). You'll notice a
README file inside, thanks to the command you just ran. What you won't
see is a .git folder, but that's because it's invisible. Git hides it in
there, but because you ran the |git init| command you know it exists. If
you're skeptical, just run the |ls| command in Git Bash/Terminal to
display a list of everything in the current directory (which, if you're
following along, is your local repository).P

So how does git know we want to commit this README file we just created?
It doesn't, and you have to tell it. This command will do the trick:P

|git add README|P

If you want to add other files to commit, you'll use the same command
but replace README with the name of a different file. Now, run this
command to commit it:P

|git commit -m 'first commit'|P

While the other commands were pretty straightforward, the commit command
has a little more going on so let's break it down. When you type |git|,
that's just telling the command line that you want to use the git
program. When you type |commit|, you're telling git you want to use the
commit command. Everything that follows those two thing count as
options. The first, /-m/, is what's known as a flag. A flag specifies
that you want to do something special rather than just run the commit
command. In this case, the -m flag means "message" and what follows it
is your commit message (in the example, 'first commit'). The message
isn't absolutely necessary (although you'll usually need to provide
one), but simply a reference to help you differentiate the various
versions of a file (or files) you commit to your repository.P

Your first commit should go by in a split second because you haven't
actually uploaded anything yet. To get this empty README file to GitHub,
you need to push it with a couple of commands. Here's the first:P

|git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Hello-World.git|P

You need to replace "yourusername" with—you guessed it—your GitHub
username. For me, it'd look like this:P

|git remote add origin https://github.com/gittest1040/Hello-World.git|P

This command tells git where to send your Hello-World repository. Now
all you need to do is send it:P

|git push origin master|P

Once you run that command, everything (in this case, just your README
file) will make it's way over to GitHub. Congratulations on your first
commit!P


      Learning MoreP

Using GitHub requires more than just committing a README file, but these
basics should give you a good grasp on how to interact with the git app
and the service. Now that you know how GitHub works at its core, you can
use the GitHub apps to manage your code instead if you prefer. If you
want to learn more about GitHub, there are some great tutorials. For
starters, take a look at how to fork a repository
<https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo> and LockerGnome's GitHub
guide
<http://www.lockergnome.com/web/2011/12/13/how-to-use-github-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects/>.P

Have fun managing your code!P

You should probably include a bit about fetching and pulling and branching.

When I was learning git I can't tell you how many times I nuked my
latest changes b/c I pulled instead of fetching first. I know there is
documentation out there, but it's all over the place and really not very
clear for the beginner.

In fact it would be a huge help to just put out a tutorial on git
itself.2/12/13 10:15am

This just got so long that I had to eventually stop. :) I would like to
get into additional information, but I think it's going to have to be
another post down the line. I just promised this one to somebody back in
December, so hopefully more in the future! We could probably do an
entire night school on this if there was enough interest.2/12/13 10:19am

Forgive my ignorance, but how does Git/GitHub handle files with
passwords in it? Say I have a config file that has the
location/user/pass for my database, but also a ton of other important
information — how do I make it so the world doesn't see the
credentials?2/12/13 10:19am

I can't imagine a scenario where this would be the case. You could
always add the config file to the .gitignore2/12/13 10:25am

normally production or even testing environment passwords are kept by
admins and not included in source codes. You might want to remove the
credentials from the file before checking in. There maybe other
important configuration items in the file besides credentials so adding
the file to gitignore might not help.2/12/13 10:32am

Is it just me or does this strike anyone else as poorly designed
software? Certain tasks lend themselves to different user interfaces,
and this seems like something that is suited to a GUI configured
service. Login, point out to a folder, let it sync, have buttons to do
common functions, that's it. I see no benefit of this software using a
command line interface when I consider what it does.2/12/13 11:06am

to be honest, neither do I or alot of people which is why there are GUI
based apps that can do the command line stuff for you. I GitHub for Mac
which is great for a beginner. There are similar programs for Windows as
well but they were not as intuitive as GitHub for Mac. It IS one of
those things that become easier to get your head around once you've done
most of the steps in the process a few times.

So after using GitHub for Mac; I have a better understanding of how this
process works even if I don't think it's the most efficient way to do
this. I'm suffering through multiple branch issues right now; issues
that I thought Git was supposed to solve in the first place.2/12/13

My impression of most source control packages is this: software for
programmers, written by programmers, designed by programmers. They're
designed to be automated through scripts or hacked at manually for
finely-grained control of how the code gets committed, pushed, and
synced. GUIs are for the "noobs" or exist solely to facilitate common
usage scenarios (so long as the command-line backend is there
hamstringing the GUI so that they can still get in there and hack at it
manually).

Personally, I think that a Dropbox-like program targeted towards
programmers that prioritized the GUI but still had many of the features
common to source control packages would do well. There are a lot of
programmers working on smaller-scale projects or in smaller teams who
don't need the finely-grained control that command-line-based source
control packages provide and would rather just be able to click a button
and commit their changes (and maybe resolve a conflict or two).
Dynamically updating to show the state of the remote repository (giving
a visual indication as to whether or not there are changesets you need
to pull) would be the cherry on top.2/12/13 11:32am

Although it's mostly oriented toward programming you can use it with
pretty much any kind of project. Last year, for example, I used it to
keep the succesive versions of a piece of music I was composing. It
saved my ass at least once.

If nothing else, you can think of it as a kind of a rather sophisticated
backup mechanism. Then there are the collaboration tools, with which I
don't have much experience and that this article -quite understandably-
does not cover.2/15/13 6:50pm

Github is a Git Remote repository hosted on the cloud. To understand
Github better, you need to know the basics of Git, concepts of Software
Configuration Management (SCM) and how Git differs from other SCM
systems like SVN etc. It is important to know that Git is a distributed
SCM which means that it will maintain an entire copy of the repository
on your local machine and this enables you to work on the software
totally disconnected from the remote repository. There is a free book
http://git-scm.com/book (even PDF floating somewhere). Good to get a
grip on Git first.2/12/13 10:28am

I highly recommend Github for Mac:

It's not perfect but I have a better understanding of repos and branches
after using it for a week in my 9-5 job.2/12/13 11:17am

I highly recommend using homebrew to install git, instead of the
standalone installer or the GUI client, if you are on OSX.2/12/13 1:14pm
